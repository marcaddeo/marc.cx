# DIY Simrig Build: Part 1: Building the Frame

<!-- @todo intro explanation of what we're building, why, and what we hope to
accomplish -->

This is the first part of my simrig build log. My goal is to build a simrig
cockpit that can support sim driving, flying, and FPS gaming comfortably. At
first, the rig will only be able to support driving. The components for
driving, i.e. the wheel/pedals/ebrake/shifter, all have very static positions
(a little bit of wiggle room of the ebrake and shifter) so I want to ensure
they're all in the correct position before I start adding the additional flight
controls and components to support FPS gaming.

## The Frame

For the first part of the build, we're going to be working on the frame of the
simgrig.

<!-- @todo go over the frame, how it is to be the inner frame, the 3d model
we're working from, how we want to eventually finish it once everything is in
place, etc. go over the challenges for the monitor mounting. setting the engle
and height of the wheel.

## The Casters

<!-- @todo just a quick section on the casters, why i like these particular
ones even though they're very expensive and how i love them, why we want
casters. pic of casters. -->
