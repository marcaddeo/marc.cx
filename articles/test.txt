    <h1>Auto Renewing SSL Certs on NGINX with Let's Encrypt</h1>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" title="" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt</a> has recently entered a public beta and I’ve been really excited
to test it out. They’re offering free SSL certs that expire every 90 days, and
are extremely easy to get. Having used Comodo in the past to get certificates,
I’ve been waiting for this day.</p>
<p>And it was everything I’d hoped it to be. The first cert I installed took minutes!
I tried the <code class="inline">letsencrypt-auto</code> client at work to get a cert for one of our internal
domains. But I wasn’t able to find an easy way to automate the <code class="inline">letsencrypt-auto</code>
and didn’t really like the fact that it generated configuration files automagically.</p>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" title="" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt</a>, I highly recommend you <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/" title="" target="_blank">donate</a> to help
further it’s development!</p>
<h2>Let's Encrypt Client</h2>
<p>Lukcily for me, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" title="" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt</a> is really a set of protocols that allow a client
to interface with their ACME auth server to generate certficiates automatically.</p>
<p>And there just so happend to be an alternative client, made by one of the core
LE developers, called <a href="https://github.com/kuba/simp_le" title="" target="_blank">simp_le</a> that better met my needs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow me to easily script and automate renewal
</li>
<li>Don’t touch configuration files
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Installing simp_le</h3>
<p>Installing the <a href="https://github.com/kuba/simp_le" title="" target="_blank">simp_le</a> client is easy.</p>
